# DAGdiscovery

This repo contains code related to a project where I developed causal discovery algorithms. The repo consists of two main folders. The 'ColoredNodes' folder contains algorithms and simulations for Gaussian DAG models under partial homoscedasticity constraints. The 'ColoredEdges' folder contains algorithms and simulations for Gaussian DAG models under compatibly colored constraints.
